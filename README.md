## Getting started

Download and install Sublime Text <a href='https://www.sublimetext.com/3'>https://www.sublimetext.com/3</a>

or Visual Studio Code <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>  

I will be using Sublime Text <a href='https://www.sublimetext.com/3'>https://www.sublimetext.com/3</a> and Google Chrome   <a href='https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download'>https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download</a> in the Sketching with Code series.   

I will be using Mac OS X and its built-in command line terminal. If you are on Windows you will need to download a command line editor that runs bash.
